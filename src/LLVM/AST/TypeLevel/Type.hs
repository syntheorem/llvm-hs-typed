This modules contains a variant of the 'LLVM.AST.Type.Type' type, suitable for
promotion to the type-level. We cannot just use 'LLVM.AST.Type.Type' directy,
as basic types such as 'Word32' are not useful as kinds, and we have to replace
them with 'GHC.TypeLits.Nat'.

Because we have to define a new type, but expect users want access to both
variants, we have to avoid name clashes. The convention is to simply append a
@'@.

This module also contains various type-level functions, classes and other
machinery that provide the necessary functionality for the typed AST.
